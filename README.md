## What did you like and thought was challenging about this project?

Well. I actually liked that it was the first time I built and deployed an app to iPhone. I don't own an android phone, but I do have a cheap tablet that I bought once because I was developing an app for android. Since then, whenever there's been an option between deploying to android and iOS, I've always chosen the first one because that felt the easiest and also I thought that deploying to iOS was this big headache of a hassle.

In this instance, though, I wanted it on the iPhone so that I could mount it onto my VR Viewer

So I'm really glad I did this. Yet another achievement on my developer batman belt.

Thank you!
