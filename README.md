## What did you like and thought was challenging about this project?

Well. I actually liked that it was the first time I built and deployed an app to iPhone. I don't own an android phone, but I do have a cheap tablet that I bought ones because I wasddeveloping an app for android, and since then, whenever there's been an option between deploying to android and iOS, I've always chosen the first one because that was easiest. Also, I've had this idea that deploying to iOS was this big hassle.

So I'm really glad I did this and it feels like another notch on my developer belt of things I've accomplished. 

Thank you!
